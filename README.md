Blink Detection for Hands-Free Computing

Overview:

This project implements a real-time blink detection system using Python, enabling hands-free interaction with digital interfaces. The system detects blinks via computer vision and machine learning techniques, converting them into mouse click actions to enhance accessibility and user experience.

Features:

âœ… Real-Time Blink Detection â€“ Accurately detects blinks from webcam input
âœ… Hands-Free Interaction â€“ Translates blinks into mouse clicks for seamless control
âœ… Touchless & Accessible â€“ Eliminates the need for physical input devices
âœ… Robust & Adaptive â€“ Works across different lighting conditions and facial structures
âœ… Error Handling & Logging â€“ Ensures system stability and smooth performance

Technologies Used:

OpenCV â€“ For video capture and image processing
dlib â€“ For facial landmark detection and eye aspect ratio (EAR) calculation
pyautogui â€“ To simulate mouse clicks based on detected blinks
pynput â€“ For precise mouse control integration

Results:

High accuracy in detecting blinks across multiple users.
Works reliably in different lighting conditions and facial features.
Screenshots of successful detections and click actions are available in the documentation.

Future Improvements:

ðŸ”¹ Multi-action support (e.g., left blink â†’ left-click, right blink â†’ right-click)
ðŸ”¹ Customizable gesture mappings
ðŸ”¹ Integration with assistive technologies
